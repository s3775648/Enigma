# Enigma
/* 
 * This Program attempts to recreate the enigma machine used in Germany before and during the war. The enigma machine
 * encrypted messages used by the German Wehrmacht as well as by industry.
 * 
 * Milestones hit: 	First rotor completed 
 * 					Send a custom message and recieve encoded output.
 * 
 * Goals: 	Add a further two rotors to the machine.
 * 			Be able to change the position of the rotors.
 *			Add a further 2 rotors that can be swapped in for others.
 *			Add a decryptor function until reflectors are added (reflectors ensure that when pressing the encrypted code the original message is returned)
 *			Add a reflector at the end of the rotors. 
 *			Add a plug board to the enigma machine
